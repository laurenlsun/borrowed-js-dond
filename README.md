# combined-js-dond
This is the final version of the JS Deal or No Deal (DOND) game for Decision Making psych study. It sends GET and POST requests to the DOND backend Python API, which is in a separate repo.
The game original code we modified can be found [here]([url](https://github.com/ta05/Deal-Or-No-Deal)). We are hosting the game website on the Google Cloud Platform.
