            Game Instructions for BANKER'S OFFER VERSION
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <p>Game Rules</p>
            <li>
              1. Choose your initial case. This case will remain with you until
              the end of the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              2. After choosing your case, you will choose and eliminate 6 cases. 
              Opening and eliminating a case eliminates the possibility of 
              winning that prize.
            </li>
            <li>
              3. Based on the remaining possible prizes, you will then have to 
              make an offer to the banker in the top left box.
            </li>
            <li>
              4. The banker will decide whether to accept or reject your offer.
              He will reject it if your offer is too high.
            </li>
            <li>
              5. If he accepts the offer, the game ends and you will win the 
              amount you have offered. If he rejects your offer, the game 
              continues and rounds will proceed; you must continue eliminating 
              cases from the board.
            </li>
            <li>
              6. Once there is 1 case left, you will have the option of choosing
              your case or the final case in the game. Click on the case of your 
              choice.
            </li>
            <li>
              7. After making your decision, the case you have chosen will open
              and display your winnings, and the game will end.
            </li>
            <li>
              8. After the game has ended, a Game ID will be displayed at the 
              bottom. You will need to enter this into the Qualtrics form.
            </li>
            <li>
              9. Once you have been given the Game ID, you can safely close out 
              of this Deal or No Deal tab or click the back button so that you 
              can return to the Qualtrics form and submit it. 
            </li>
